### What is a test spy?
A test spy is a function that records arguments and thrown exceptions (if any) for all its calls.

### Creating a spy as an anonymous function
The spy wonâ€™t do anything except record information about its calls. A common use case for this type of spy is testing how a function handles a callback:

```javascript
const {spy} = require('m.spy')

test('calls listeners on event', () => {
  const callback = spy()
  const emitter = new EventEmitter()

  emitter.on('event', callback)
  emitter.emit('event')

  assertTrue(callback.called)
})
```

#### spy.called
Is `true` if the spy was called at least once.

#### spy.notCalled
Is `true` if the spy was not called.

#### spy.callCount
The number of recorded calls.

#### spy.args
Array of arguments received, spy.args[0] is an array of arguments received in the first call.

#### spy.calledWith(arg1[, arg2[, ...]])
Returns `true` if spy was called at least once with the provided arguments. Can be used for partial matching, only provided arguments are checked against the actual arguments.

#### spy.returned(arg1)
Returns `true` if spy returned the provided value at least once. Uses deep comparison for objects and arrays.
